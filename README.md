# PolarizationDemultiplexer
Code for inverse design project to simulate a nanophotonic device we are calling a polarization demultiplexer (or entangelment transducer).

> IMPORTANT -- only the x-dipole-one-output code is 'up-to-date.' The rest need updated, but some additional info is below:

> The analysis and simplified_poldemux codes are included here as a starting point, they were created using an older version of pymeep and must be updated by following the structure in the X-dipole-one-output example. They are here to demonstrate how we are saving/loading data between the optimization and analysis using h5py. The same goes for the 3D-crossed-wg example, it provides a starting point for setting a 3D sim up, but will most likely not work if run as-is.
