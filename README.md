# PolarizationDemultiplexer
Code for inverse design project to simulate a nanophotonic device we are calling a polarization demultiplexer (or entangelment transducer).

> Currently the X-dipole-one-output example should be working, the rest need updated as they haven't been touched for a few months while other issues are worked out.

> The analysis and simplified_poldemux codes are here as a starting point, they were created using an older version of pymeep and must be updated by following the structure in the X-dipole-one-output example
