# PolarizationDemultiplexer
Code for inverse design project to simulate a nanophotonic device we are calling a polarization demultiplexer (or entangelment transducer).

> Currently the coupling to single waveguide (optimization) example should be working, the rest definitely need updated as they haven't been touched for a few months while other issues are worked out.
